The [Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) initially formed as a graduate department in 1977, the Department of Statistics began operating as an independent department in 1979 under the inaugural chairmanship of Donald A.S. Fraser.  The University of Toronto has many notable alumni that are great leaders in statistical sciences, including Art Dempster, Rudy Beran, David Brillinger, John Chambers, Steve Fienberg, Daryl Pregibon, Mary Thompson, Ross Prentice, Rob Tibshirani, and Larry Wasserman.  The explosion of interest in data science has triggered an accelerated expansion of the department’s inter-disciplinary research and a rapid growth of our community – from faculty to undergraduate and graduate students. Today, our enrolment rate is among the highest in North America.

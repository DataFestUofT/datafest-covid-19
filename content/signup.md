The ASA DataFest: COVID-19 Virtual Data Challenge is a collaborative competition, so we strongly encourage you to work in a team to honor the spirit of the competition. If your current situation does not make it feasible for you to work on a team, you can still participate individually, although your work will not be evaluated by our judging panel.

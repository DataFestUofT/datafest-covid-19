### How large are the teams? 

Teams can be made up of 2 to 4 students.

### Do I have to compete in a team? 

DataFest is a collaborative competition, so we strongly encourage you to work in a team to honor the spirit of the competition. If your current situation does not make it feasible for you to work on a team, you can still participate individually, but your project will not be evaluated by the judging panel.

### How do I sign up to participate? 

[Submit an application](/signup.html) by **Sunday, May 24, 23:59 EDT** for your team to join the event.  NB: The number of teams that will be selected to be evaluated by the judging panel is limited, although you may still participate, and use your project to build your professional portfolio with the support of the [Independent Summer Statistics Community (ISSC)](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/SitePages/ISSC-Home.aspx).

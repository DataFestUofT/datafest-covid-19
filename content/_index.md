There is currently a lot of work being done on modeling direct health outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as prediction new cases or mortality rates. You can read more about the complexities of doing such analyses in the article ["Why It’s So Freaking Hard to Make a Good COVID-19 Model”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/). 

For this competition, we challenge you to “tell us about something affected by the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes”. In other words, we challenge you to explore other the societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. You can explore everything from the effects on pollution levels, transportation levels, or working from home. You can investigate changes in the number of people posting on TikTok with their families or do an analysis on online education. The focus is up to you! We just encourage you to be thoughtful and creative as you analyze data and communicate your insights about some of the impacts on society. 

The challenge for this DataFest event is to

- choose an outcome such as one of these (or something entirely different we haven’t thought of here!), 
- find the appropriate data to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on this issue, and
- present your findings (along with the dataset you used).


Below are a few suggestions to get you started, but you should feel welcomed to focus on a question different than these.

- How has the pandemic affected the airline industry and what are some potential downstream effects of this other than economic strain on the industry?
- As a student, how would you quantify the effect of the pandemic on your education?
- With shelter in place / lockdown in place, many workers have started working from home, which requires internet access. How prepared was the nation / your local area for this shift?
- How has the spread of the pandemic affected people’s opinion on government tracking and privacy?
- What is the effect of the social distancing / shelter in place / lockdown recommendations and policies on pollution?
- How can we quantify the potential effects on nutrition and general health of the public, outside of those affected by the virus?
- How are refugees affected by COVID-19?

Finally, we have always framed ASA DataFest as a collaborative competition, but this is even more true this year. Local judges will still recognize projects that stand out from the rest on categories like Best Insight, Best Visualization, and Most Creative Dataset or Topic, but we encourage you, now more than ever, to share sources you found useful, approaches you found to be fruitful, or methods you want to learn more about with each other.

Your final product should be:

- A slide deck (maximum 3 content slides + title slide) **<u>OR</u>** an interactive app / dashboard
accompanied by
- EITHER a 5 minute video **<u>OR</u>** a one-page write up.

Note that by participating in ASA DataFest you are agreeing to the A[SA Activities Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Meetings/Meeting-Conduct-Policy.aspx), which applies to all interactions related to ASA DataFest.
